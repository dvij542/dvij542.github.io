abstract: With the rapid advancement and increased use of deep learning models in image identification, security becomes a major concern to their deployment in safety-critical systems. Since the accuracy and robustness of deep learning models are primarily attributed from the purity of the training samples, therefore the deep learning architectures are often susceptible to adversarial attacks. Adversarial attacks are often obtained by making subtle perturbations to normal images, which are mostly imperceptible to humans, but can seriously confuse the state-of-the-art machine learning models. We propose a framework, named APuDAE, leveraging Denoising AutoEncoders (DAEs) to purify these samples by using them in an adaptive way and thus improve the classification accuracy of the target classifier networks that have been attacked. We also show how using DAEs adaptively instead of using them directly, improves classification accuracy further and is more robust to the possibility of designing adaptive attacks to fool them. We demonstrate our results over MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet dataset and show how our framework (APuDAE) provides comparable and in most cases better performance to the baseline methods in purifying adversaries. We also design adaptive attack specifically designed to attack our purifying model and demonstrate how our defense is robust to that.
