title: Using Gated Graph ConvNets for trajectory prediction
summary: Motion prediction is one of the core functions of an autonomous driving car. This can serve as an important tool for path planning considering dynamic obstacles whose trajectory can be predicted. Gated Graph ConvNets having Node-Edge-Node communication are used to effectively formulate the relations between the neighboring vehicles. The future motion of the vehicles is predicted with accuracy up to 4 meters on average for next 3 seconds.
